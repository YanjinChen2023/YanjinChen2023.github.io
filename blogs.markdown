###Chromatin context-dependent regulation and epigenetic manipulation of prime editing

## Abstract:

Characterize the impact of cis-chromatin environment on prime editing efficiecy. Can modulate efficiency of prime editing through epignome editing.

## Introduction:

The cis-chromatin environment in modulating the efficiency of prime editing remains largely uncharacterized. Reason: many epigenetic factors can interact with DNA repair factors to modulate kinetics of DNA damage response. They developed chromatin sensors along with a reporter mapping assay to access their locations, and observed highly variable prime editing outcomes across genomic contexts. Then they explore more by performing functional genomic screens and discovered previously uncharacterized factors that play chromatin context-dependent roles. They also explored the idea of first editing the epigenome of the target region before doing prime editing, they find out that transient gene activationby CRISPRa before can enhance editing efficiency.

## Results:

The prime editor generally favors transcriptionally active regions and is most proficient immediately downstream of TSSs. The role of HLTF is rediscovere, and they hypothesized that HLTF might be unevenly distributted along chromatin. For epigenome reprogramming, they observed 20 fold increases in editing frequencies when corresponding targets were activated by CRISPRa.

## Limitations:

Epigenetics annotations still incomplete. Cannot assess the impact of individual nucleosomes immediately surrouding TSSs on prime editing outcomes. No exploration in terms of target sequence, mutation type and cis-chromatin environment.
